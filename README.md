### Project Proposal: Real-time Reddit Data Analysis and Insights System for E-commerce

#### Overview
The project outlined in this proposal is designed to serve as a sophisticated analytics platform that streams, processes, and analyzes Reddit comments related to e-commerce companies such as Walmart, Amazon, CVS, and more. This system will classify user comments by categories like apparel, medicine, or food and will provide real-time insights into consumer behavior, market trends, and sentiment analysis.

#### Target Audience
The primary audience for this project includes e-commerce companies, market researchers, and business strategists who are looking for real-time consumer feedback and trends to better understand market dynamics and improve customer engagement strategies.

#### Desired Insights
This project aims to deliver a comprehensive view of consumer sentiment and discussion trends on Reddit, focusing on e-commerce. Insights include:

1. **Sentiment Analysis**: Understanding consumer sentiment towards products and services for strategic adjustments.
2. **Trend Detection**: Identifying emerging trends in discussions related to specific categories like apparel, health products, and food items.
3. **Competitive Analysis**: Comparing sentiment and discussion volume across different companies.
4. **Market Response**: Gauging consumer response to new product launches, promotions, and other market interventions.

#### Metrics
- **Metric Name** - **Metric Derivation** - **Description**
  - `m_sentiment_score` - `Derived from NLP analysis` - Sentiment score associated with each comment.
  - `m_category_volume` - `Count of comments per category` - Volume of comments in each category.
  - `m_positive_sentiment_percentage` - `Positive comments / total comments` - Percentage of comments that are positive.
  - `m_negative_sentiment_percentage` - `Negative comments / total comments` - Percentage of comments that are negative.
  - `m_neutral_sentiment_percentage` - `Neutral comments / total comments` - Percentage of comments that are neutral.

#### Data and Architecture
- **Data Retrieval**: Utilize Reddit API to stream comments in real-time, filtering for mentions of specific e-commerce companies.
- **Data Processing**: Employ NLP models to classify comments by category and analyze sentiment, using technologies like Apache Kafka for data ingestion and Apache Flink for stream processing.
- **Data Storage**: Store processed data in PostgreSQL for immediate retrieval and long-term storage in Apache Iceberg for scalability and efficient data management.
- **Visualization**: Real-time dashboards created in Tableau to display insights from the processed data.

####**Data Model**

#### Implementation Plan
- **Phase 1: Setup and Initial Data Retrieval**
  - Set up infrastructure using Docker containers for PostgreSQL, Kafka, and Flink.
  - Develop Kafka producers for streaming data from Reddit.
  - Establish initial stream processing pipelines in Flink for data classification and sentiment analysis.

- **Phase 2: Data Analysis and Visualization**
  - Implement real-time data processing for continuous updates.
  - Develop Tableau dashboards to visualize key metrics and insights.
  - Integrate processed data with PostgreSQL for real-time querying and reporting.

- **Phase 3: Testing and Deployment**
  - Conduct comprehensive testing of all components to ensure accurate data processing and reliable performance.
  - Deploy the system in a production environment, ensuring robust operation and scalability.
  - Monitor system performance and make adjustments as needed based on initial feedback.

#### Potential Use Cases
- **Real-Time Consumer Insight Monitoring**: Continuously analyze consumer discussions to provide immediate insights to marketing teams and business strategists.
- **Predictive Trend Analysis**: Use historical data and real-time input to predict emerging trends in consumer preferences and market demands.
- **Competitive Benchmarking**: Enable businesses to benchmark against competitors by analyzing consumer sentiment and discussion volume.

#### Conclusion
The Real-time Reddit Data Analysis and Insights System will offer e-commerce stakeholders a dynamic tool to understand and respond to consumer sentiment and market trends effectively. By leveraging cutting-edge data processing technologies and real-time analytics, this system will provide valuable insights that can drive strategic decisions and foster competitive advantage.

#### Next Steps
- Finalize the project design and gather the necessary technological resources.
- Begin Phase 1 with the setup of Kafka, Flink, and PostgreSQL.
- Develop and test initial data retrieval and processing scripts to ensure accuracy and efficiency.

I look forward to advancing this project to bring real-time consumer insights into the e-commerce space, enhancing strategic decision-making and market responsiveness.
